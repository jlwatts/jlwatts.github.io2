Imaging Raspbian without an PC
* Using [Android App RasPiCard Imager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redrobe.raspicardimager)
* Add a file called `wpa_supplicant.conf` to the boot directory, containing something like: 

`country=<Two Letter Country code, like GB, US, FR>
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="<ssid>"
    psk="<network key>"
}
`

SSH
* Add a blank `ssh` file to the boot directory
* [Setup SSH and copy keys from Windows 10 PowerShell](https://blogs.endjin.com/2019/09/passwordless-ssh-from-windows-10-to-raspberry-pi/ )
* `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` and edit the PasswordAuthentication to `no`
* Restart the ssh by rebooting the Pi `sudo reboot`

OpenVPN
* Use (http://www.pivpn.io/) and these [additional instructions](https://www.sitepoint.com/setting-up-a-home-vpn-using-your-raspberry-pi/)

DDClient for dynamic DNS
* [Best guide I have found](https://samhobbs.co.uk/2015/01/dynamic-dns-ddclient-raspberry-pi-and-ubuntu)

GitHub
* GiHhub help pages are very good and guide you through the process to [link git to a GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git)
