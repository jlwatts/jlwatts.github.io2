1. Get an image
    * Imaging Raspbian without an PC - Using [Android App RasPiCard Imager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redrobe.raspicardimager)
    * With a PC - just download the image from https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/
2. Before inserting the SD card into the PI
    * Add a file called `wpa_supplicant.conf` to the boot directory, containing something like: 
    ```country=<Two Letter Country code, like GB, US, FR>
    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1
    network={
    ssid="<ssid>"
    psk="<network key>"
    }```
    * Add a blank `ssh` file to the boot directory

SSH
1. [Setup SSH and copy keys from Windows 10 PowerShell](https://blogs.endjin.com/2019/09/passwordless-ssh-from-windows-10-to-raspberry-pi/)
2. `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` and edit the PasswordAuthentication to `no`
3. * Restart the ssh by rebooting the Pi `sudo reboot`

OpenVPN
* Use (http://www.pivpn.io/) and these [additional instructions](https://www.sitepoint.com/setting-up-a-home-vpn-using-your-raspberry-pi/)
