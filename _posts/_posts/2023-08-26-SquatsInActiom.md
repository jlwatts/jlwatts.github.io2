Took Squats to my third tournament on Saturday. 

Chaos Cultists lost by 5 points on open
Intersession won by a point on ITD
Corsairs won by a point on open
 Kommandos lost by 6 on open

I took the same list in all the games but Kommandos:

Theyn with plasma pistol - used her for Melee in all games and she did well killing of models in two games but died in three - probably better to take ranged options and have her snipe from the back field.

Comms - The extra APL is critical don't leave them behind and positioning is key. I got stuck at one point only being able to buff the medic. I dropped them for the Lokitar in the Kommando game to deny sneaky gits. This was so the wrong swap Lokitar was useless - couldn't even kill a grot in melee. 

Medic - saved a gunner at twice which kept me in the games. 

Jump Pack - Really needs the extra APL from comms TP1 to be useful.  Found it was best to stick to the game plan of recovering your item or tapping a point. Letting them get distracted and charge someone before TP3 is a great way to get them killed or wounded and then you need to scramble to save them and your item leaving you open elsewhere.  

Lugger - auto take for the extra equipment - also took those further points loot and secure objectives TP1 with his free mission action (also swooped in to save the recovery item after jump pack tried and failed to be the hero).

Kognitar - Hid for most of the games or was a backup on holding objectives - failed to kill an elf despite having a plasma knife. But they are an auto take for the the attack/defence token. This was key to pulling off/surviving some attacks. 

Grenadier - Was pretty useless for me, only as ever took out 1 operative with their charge. The limited range and blast stopped them doing the magic I've seen them do. But needs TAAW and multiple grudge tokens to truly be effective - I wouldn't throw away the charge otherwise.

Rail Rifle - epic, took out big threats for me like torments, easily the best shooting but needs TAAW ploy to be model and those grudges to score big on the MWs. Dropped for the rotary cannon against Kommandos -  again a bad swap, should have kept it to push MWs which cannot be just a scratched away. 

Plasma Beam - didn't pull off a beam but the 2AP is great for killing elites. 

Missile Launcher - only effective blast weapon in the team in this outing wiping out a few cultist (but there were so many more).

Gunners - really need to be supported by Proximal Firepower - however even then the number of 1,1,2,2s I rolled wasn't even funny. Only the rotary cannon scored hits some TPs, but only chip damage. 

Lokatar denying forward be deploy is a feel bad moment and does not set a good tone for the game (even if you explain it prior to deployment). and other wise the model is useless. I would have probably enjoyed working out how to avoid the alpha strike which was coming and having a better model on the board. 

Cool models aside I don't they are a 'fun' team. As others have said you need to think carefully before each move (we ran up to and over the clock a few times). There is a lot of dependency between models and so you need to keep your buffers alive leaving you  only attacking with gunners. This feels undwarfish - Thorin Oakenshield wouldn't approve.
