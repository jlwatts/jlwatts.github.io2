So you found my little corner of the Net where I pour out my soul in proses, poetry and photographs.

Nah. That doesn't sound like me - this is just a place for me to play around with a [Jekyll Now](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) / [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) / [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) blog before I get bored with it and go back to Wordpress.

### About me

During the day I work as a software tester, which depending on your point of view means:
1. I tap / click around the screen until something breaks ...or...
1. I'm responsible for making sure software does what it should ...or...
1. I crush devs' hopes and dreams into tiny itty bitty pieces ...or...
1. I find bugs ...or...
1. I try to help people think about the quality of what they are designing, building and testing. 

The truth is probably up there, somewhere.

The rest of the time I try to distract  the pedantic, fault-finding part of myself by shooting arrows, taking photographs, playing with technology and jogging.
